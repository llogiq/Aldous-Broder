# Aldous-Broder

This is an exercise in exploring rust as a language, and for this project, I am attempting to implement the maze generating algorithm of Aldous-Broder. 

I got the main algorithm from the site

http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/17/maze-generation-aldous-broder-algorithm

There are probably many things that I could have done better in this implementation. If you also believe so and have some suggestions, please let me know.
